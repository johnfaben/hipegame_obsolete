The code for this project is heavily based of Miguel Grinberg's Flask tutorial (http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com). 

It is an implementation of the game of HIPE, which appears in a bonus chapter in Peter Winkler's excellent book 'Mathematical Puzzles: a Connoisseur's Collection'. If you like mathematical puzzles, that book is the best one I've read by some margina, and I've read a lot.

This is mostly a project for me to learn something about Flask and how to host some simple python scripts so they run online, but it might be a fun game too when I've finished.
